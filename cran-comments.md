## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Removed the maintainer from DESCRIPTION. Maintainer will be generated by Author@R.

* More clearly identified the copyright holders in the DESCRIPTION.

* Added the following to NAMESPACE file.
    importFrom("graphics", "plot") 
    importFrom("methods", "new")
    importFrom("stats", "predict")
    importClassesFrom(darch,DArch)
    
* Updated the examples so they run in less than 5 s.
  

## Test environments
* Windows 10, R 3.2.4
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.4

## R CMD check results
* There is no warning or note.

## Downstream dependencies
* This is a new package. There is no any downstream dependency.
