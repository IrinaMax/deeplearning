Title: An implementation of deep neural network for regression and classification
Description: An implementation of deep neural network with rectifier linear units (ReLU) that are trained
	with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and batch normalization. A combination of these methods have
	achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in imageNet classification by overcoming the gradient saturation
	problem experienced in the past when training neural networks with over three to four hidden layers. In addtion, dropout
	method (Srivastava 2014) is implemented as a regularization. deeplearning package is inspired by darch package and uses
	of its classes and functions.
